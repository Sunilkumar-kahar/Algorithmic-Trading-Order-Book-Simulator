PROJECT NAME: Algorithmic Trading Order Book Simulator.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A C++ based order book simulator that models how financial exchanges handle buy/sell orders using price-quantity priority matching. Built to demonstrate core concepts of algorithmic trading, matching engines, and order management systems.

FEATURES:
1. Place Orders: Supports both BUY and SELL orders with unique IDs.
2. Modify Orders: Update price and quantity for open orders.
3. Cancel Orders: Remove pending orders from the book.
4. Matching Engine: Matches incoming orders with existing ones based on price-time priority.
5. Order Book Display: View current bids, asks, and quantities.
6. Handles partial fills, and cleans up fully executed orders.

TECHNOLOGIES:
1. C++ (C++11/14)
2. STL Containers: map, unordered_map, list
3. g++ (MinGW-W64)
4. WINDOWS-11
5. VS Code 

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
1. Add multi-threaded matching for HFT simulation.
2. Build client-server architecture for external order submission.
